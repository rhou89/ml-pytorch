Homework for [*Introduction to Machine Learning* by Duke University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-duke).

- To install PyTorch via Anaconda:
```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

- To install PyTorch via pip (Python 3):
```shell
pip3 install torch torchvision
```

A good online notebook service is [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) by Google, where you can also play with TensorFlow. The best part is that you also have free access to GPU resources.
